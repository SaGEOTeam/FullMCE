Full MCE is a QGIS plugin presented in a user-friendly and easy-to-use graphical interface. It is dedicated to Spatialized Multicriteria Evaluation: 
-	Constraints reclassification
-	Factors standardization
-	Weighting by pairwise comparison method
-	Aggregation by weighted linear combination method

Full MCE was developed using Python 2 and runs with 2.x QGIS versions.

Initially developed for a malaria risk spatial modeling project on the Malagasy Central Highlands, Full MCE can be used in other context (other diseases, agriculture, urban, etc.) and can be adapted to different geographical scales.
